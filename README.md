# Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets
> **Identifying-Tweets-About-Real-Disasters**

In recent years, social media has gotten lots of attention for its potential use in spatial and temporal events. Twitter is one of them that has become an important communication channel in different situations, for instance, in times of emergency. Smartphones enable people to announce an emergency they see in real-time. Because of that, more agencies are interested in monitoring Twitter (e.g., disaster relief organizations(NDRF)). The idea behind this work is that we can take a large body of tweets and extract a useful summary that could have been useful in disaster situations.
The problem to be solved by this capstone project is how to identify which tweets are about 'real disasters' and which ones aren't. For the obvious reason, this Project is treated Classification Problem.

The Dataset in the Project used from [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started).
